# BMW E30 Gauge Cluster Late Model
The goal for this project is to reverse engineer every PCB in the gauge cluster for Late model year BMW E30's. This includes the main PCB referred to as the "Nexus" board, the SI (Service Interval) board, and the smaller boards that are part of the tachometer and speedometer gauge assemblies.

# Early Model Clusters:
If you have an early model cluster and need parts for that, check out the progress of the early model project here: https://github.com/Ansel84/BMW-E30-Gauge-Cluster-Early-Model
